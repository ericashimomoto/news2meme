Japanese researchers developed computerized chopsticks that use an electrical stimulation waveform to enhance the taste of food.

Researchers tested the chopsticks on people who follow a low-sodium diet. Japanese people tend to eat a large amount of salt in their diet; however, to prevent severe lifestyle diseases, the amount needs to lower. If people try to avoid salt, they need to avoid their favorite foods, or they need to eat flavorless food.

The chopsticks are connected to a device on the eater’s wrist. A weak electric current moves sodium ions and pulls them in the food. Then the eater’s tongue feels the salty taste enhanced by up to one and a half times.

Difficult words: electrical stimulation waveform (energy that comes out in small regular amounts), enhance (to improve the quality, amount, or strength of something, sodium ion (a chemical that’s necessary in small amounts for some living things).
